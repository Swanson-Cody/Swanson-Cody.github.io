                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever visited a site and got annoying ads that played video and audio? There was nothing you could do nothing about it? Well, if you can't beat them, join them!
                    <video width="320" autoplay>
                        <source src="cookietimefun.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, lets add controls to a video!
                    <video width="320" controls poster="alanphoto.jpg">
                        <source src="snowtimefun.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who says that silent movies are out of fashion?
                    <video width="320" muted controls poster="alansittingphoto.jpg">
                        <source src="snowtimefun.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video>
                </p>
                <p>
                    How about having something loop over and over?
                    <video width="320" loop controls>
                        <source src="tapetimefun.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Your broswer does not support the video tag.
                    </video>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>
                    Audio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Audio can also utilize fun fuctions like autoplay controls, loop and muted.
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="birthdaysong.m4a" type="audio/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the audio tag.
                    </audio>&#9835;&#9833;&#9836;&#9834;&#9834;&#9836;&#9833;&#9835;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Added loop for sake of showing code proficiency.
                    <audio controls loop>
                        <source src="ibelieveinchrist.m4a" type="audio/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the audio tag.
                    </audio>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>
                    Canvas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Canvas is used for drawing graphics on a webpage. It uses JavaScript to do the drawing. HTML5 canvas is just a container for it. Also, canvas is simply a rectangular area. For example:
                    <canvas id="seeCanvas" width="400" height="200">
                    </canvas>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is an example of utilizing canvas for creating shapes and words:
                    <canvas id="canvasShape" width="400" height="200">
                    </canvas>
                </p>
            </section>
        </div>
        <script src="canvas.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
